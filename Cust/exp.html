	<p>In the English translation of Antonin Artaud’s collection of essays about the illusion of theatre published in 1938 called ‘Theatre and its Double’ the translator uses the first coinage the phrase ‘virtual reality’ in print.
The science fiction author Stanley G. Weinbaum in his novel ‘Pygymalion’s Spectacles’ also described virtual reality simulating real-life sensations in the 1930s.

	<p>Morton Helig produced the first virtual reality experience, Sensorama, in 1957. His innovation was later copyrighted in 1962. Sensorama was a little theatre (akin to an arcade game) that simulated touch, smell, and taste.The simulation, which incorporated a vibrating chair, scent generators, a 3D motion image, and wind, was a significant leap in virtual reality design.
	<br><br>Although the Telesphere Mask was the first head-mounted display, it was not interactive. The VR headgear provided the user with stereoscopic vision and sound and may have served as the inspiration for Sutherland's later headgear.
